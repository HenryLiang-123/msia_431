As seen in the histogram, the crime in Chicago is highest in the summer, and lowest in the winter months.
This might be because of the weather. Winters in Chicago are very cold, and there are very little people
out on the streets, which means less crime can happen. When its summer time, Warmer weather and longer days
can provide better conditions for criminals to operate, making it easier to commit crimes under the cover of
darkness.
